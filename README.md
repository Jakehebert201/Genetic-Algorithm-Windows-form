# Genetic Algorithm in Windows Forms

This is a GUI implementation and improvement of my previous github repo- Gradient-Descent. This one fully implements a GUI, complete with user-defined inputs, iterative tables and plots, and the ability to reset the program.  
I completed this implementing ScottPlot and Angouri Math for math formatting.

## Future improvements
I have the functionality to compare the Gradient Descent algorithm to the genetic algorithm, so that will likely be next
